# CS_255_System_Analysis_And_Design
This repository includes my final portfolio for my SNHU course of CS 255 System Analysis and Design.

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was designed to improve the preparation process for individuals taking their DMV driving tests by providing both online practice tests and in-person driving lessons. The client, DriverPass, wanted a system that would allow customers to schedule lessons, track their progress on practice tests, and manage their overall learning experience. Key features included lesson scheduling, progress tracking, secure user management, and the ability to access the system from both desktop and mobile platforms.

What did you do particularly well?

One area where I excelled in this project was creating clear and comprehensive UML diagrams, particularly the Use Case and Activity diagrams. These diagrams effectively captured the different user interactions and system processes, which helped streamline the overall design and ensured the system met the client’s needs​. Additionally, I focused on security measures like role-based access control and SSL encryption to protect sensitive user data, which addressed the client’s concerns about protecting customer information and maintaining system integrity.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise one part of my work, it would be the nonfunctional requirements section of the business requirements document. While I ensured that security, performance, and scalability were included, I believe I could have enhanced this section by further exploring platform constraints and compatibility. Specifically, I would provide more detail on how the system would handle older devices or browsers, which could improve the user experience across a wider range of devices​. This could be refined by conducting additional testing on older platforms and outlining more specific contingency plans for performance issues during peak usage times.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Understanding the user’s needs was central to designing this system. DriverPass required a platform that was both accessible and secure, enabling customers to manage their lessons, track progress, and interact with various system components seamlessly. By integrating role-based access, tracking capabilities, and a straightforward interface, I ensured that each user type—whether an admin, secretary, or customer—could easily perform their designated tasks. It’s critical to consider user needs in system design because the functionality and usability of the system ultimately depend on whether it meets the expectations and workflow of the end users​. Without this focus, the system could fail to deliver value to the client.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My approach to designing software involved a combination of user-centered design principles and iterative development. I employed techniques such as creating detailed UML diagrams early in the design process to map out system behaviors and interactions before moving into code implementation. This ensured that the system architecture was well-documented and easily understandable. Moving forward, I will continue to apply this structured approach, incorporating user feedback and refining system components iteratively to adapt to changing requirements and expectations.
